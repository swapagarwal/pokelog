A Shell for a Rule-based Expert System in Prolog

It handles uncertainty (both in facts and rules) and provides an explanation as to how it is being calculated.

The shell supports the following commands:

`fact.` Add a fact with a certainty factor.

`rule.` Add a rule with a certainty factor.

`expert.` Ask a question and get its certainty.
